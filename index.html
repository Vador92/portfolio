        <div class="brief">
            <p>Currently I am a Software Engineer [backend] based in New York City Metropolitan Area. Having recently graduated, 
                I am excited to figure out the ropes and business procedures that I am to learn throughout my experience. 
                Failure is something I have adopted to my mindset, where being able to not only realize but reflect on 
                this to further to reach my goal in the tech world.</p>
            <p>Beyond my current day job, I experiment around with different frameworks whether it be web development or indie game development. 
                My current project is creating a platform for finding the perfect couch-coop game with your friends. 
                I truly believe that this era was one of the best times.</p>
            <p>
                Checkout my projects on <a href="https://github.com/Vador92" target="_blank">Github</a>. 
                By no means is it where I want it to be. However,
                I want to have a more solidified project experience, rather than jumping around.
